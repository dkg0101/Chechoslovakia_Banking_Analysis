1. What is the demographic profile of the bank's clients and how does it vary across 
districts?
2. How the banks have performed over the years. What are the most common types of accounts and how do they differ
    regarding usage and profitability?
4. Which types of cards are most frequently used by the bank's clients and what is the 
overall profitability of the credit card business?
5. What is the bankâ€™s loan portfolio and how does it vary across different purposes and 
client segments?

### Step 2:
Create respective tables and load data in MySQL database, establish and manage relationships among tables using foreign key 
constraints and data integrity. Apply advanced data transformation techniques to get the data ready for analysis. This includes
tasks like transforming data values using given info, adding new columns to store newly derived values and fill missing values, Creating KPIs table using joins and case statements.

### Step 3:
Once data is transformed and ready for analysis, load it into the Power BI Desktop application by establishing a connection with the MySQL database.
